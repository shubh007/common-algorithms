Here we will post some common algorithms which can make our life easier 

**1) [Lee Algorithm ](src/main/java/page/tailf/common/algorithms/lee):** A possible solution for shortest path in a maze routing problems based on Breadth-first search. It always gives an optimal solution, if one exists, but is slow and requires considerable memory. [here are the test cases](src/test/java/page/tailf/common/algorithms/lee)
